To run this project you first need to set up **VS Code, Andriod Studio, Android SDK,** and **Flutter** on your computer/laptop.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

After Setup, Download this project and use the flutter run command. (Make sure you have a mobile device connected with USB Debugging turned On)

So make sure to run the APK(to directly run on mobile devices) and review the code, and give me some feedback ðŸ˜Š.
